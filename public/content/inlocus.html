            <p>
              With IoT devices producing more data than anyone can deal with, we need a new architecture with a focus on data reduction and distributed summarization. This enables application programmers to hone the data deluge into focused, meaningful insights, without having to see all the data at once.
            </p>
            <p>
              The InLocus computational model distributes small, (possibly stateful) functions near data sources. Moving compute resources closer to data sources improves latency and frees up centralized application servers to focus more on business logic rather than low-level bits and bytes.
            </p>
              <p>
              In a way, this is similar to the division of labor between a conventional CPU and its various peripherals such as the USB and Ethernet buses.
