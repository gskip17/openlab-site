              OSiRIS is a pilot project funded by the NSF to evaluate a software-defined storage infrastructure for our primary Michigan research universities. OSiRIS will combine a number of innovative concepts to provide a distributed, multi-institutional storage infrastructure that will allow researchers at any of our three campuses to read, write, manage and share their data directly from their computing facility locations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our goal is to provide transparent, high-performance access to the same storage infrastructure from well-connected locations on any of our campuses. We intend to enable this via a combination of network discovery, monitoring and management tools and through the creative use of CEPH features.

            <p>
              By providing a single data infrastructure that supports computational access on the data “in-place”, we can meet many of the data-intensive and collaboration challenges faced by our research communities and enable these communities to easily undertake research collaborations beyond the border of their own Universities.
